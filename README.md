Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder, and seriously, what a weird, wild trip that was. It’s like I just ate an entire chili pepper without realizing it—spicy, unpredictable, and sure, maybe a bit uncomfortable. I’m kind of tired from it all, not gonna lie. But here I am, though—still chewing on bits of the   like they’re leftover popcorn hulls stuck in my teeth. Ugh.

I mean, what was with all the running around in those dingy prisons? I felt like I needed to shower ten times just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. The prisons felt so grimy you could almost smell the mildew and regret. Seriously, though, everyone there had this sweaty, shifty look like they just got caught stealing cookies—or maybe that's just how I imagined it. Isn’t it kind of mind-boggling to have the whole I’m in a prison but hey, I can still have friends over vibe? And that tour guide stuff—who knew you could run a little travel enterprise from behind bars?

> Did anyone else feel the emotions stuck halfway between a laugh and a WTF moment? Like, some of these hits land with the grace of a cat jumping into a fish tank. I can’t tell if I was moved or just confused. The main dude, man, he had this whole shifty charisma going. It’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a fox convince chickens to open a door to the henhouse. I was just sucked into his little charming universe, and I kinda wanted to slap him and hug him at the same time. Is that normal? Is that what this   did to me?

So, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you ever feel like questioning what reality even means. Will it be worth it? I dunno—is it ever worth eating an entire jar of pickles at 2 a.m.? You just have to decide that for yourself. Or don't.

random code snippet? why the heck not.

```cpp
void smuggle(char goods, int quantity) {
    if(quantity <= 0) return;
    // this doesn’t really work, but it’s not supposed to
    while(goods[quantity] != 'x') { 
        goods[quantity--] = 'x'; 
    }
}
```

Anyway, that’s it—I’m off to try and process this rollercoaster of conflicting vibes. Think I need to go stare at a wall for five hours to let it sink in. Or maybe I'll just nap instead.
